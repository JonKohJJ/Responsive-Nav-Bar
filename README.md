# Responsive-Nav-Bar
Live: https://jonkohjj.github.io/responsive-nav-bar/

Hey there!
This is a responsive navigation bar that is implemented purely using HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript, without the use of any libraries e.g. bootstrap etc. Feel free to try it out!

Main concepts used:

1. display: flex
2. width percentages
3. media queries
4. position: absolute and transform: tranlateX property to hide nav bar
5. toggle classlist using Javascript to show/hide nav bar
